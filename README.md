Structural bioinformatics analysis of Methionine Aminopeptidase-1 (MetAP1) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
# Structural Bioinformatics Analysis of MetAP1 (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)

## Background
Methionine Aminopeptidase-1 (MetAP1) is an essential enzyme involved in protein maturation and represents a potential therapeutic target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

This project is based on my MSc Bioinformatics thesis and applies structure-based computational approaches to analyse MetAP1 and identify potential inhibitory molecules.

## Objectives
- Identify MetAP1 as a potential drug target through literature review
- Perform molecular docking to screen potential inhibitors
- Evaluate protein–ligand stability using molecular dynamics simulations
- Analyse structural and conformational changes over time

## Tools & Technologies
- Schrödinger (GLIDE, LigPrep, MM-GBSA)
- GROMACS
- PyMOL
- BLAST
- Python
- Linux environment

## Key Outcomes
- Identified stable protein–ligand interactions
- Observed conformational stability during MD simulations
- Demonstrated structure-based reasoning applicable to drug and antigen design
