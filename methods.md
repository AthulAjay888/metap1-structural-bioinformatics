# Methodology

## Target Identification
Literature review was conducted to identify Methionine Aminopeptidase-1 (MetAP1) as a biologically relevant drug target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

## Protein Structure Preparation
- Protein structure retrieved from public databases
- Structure cleaned and prepared for docking

## Molecular Docking
- Docking performed using Schrödinger suite
- Binding poses analysed based on binding energy and interaction profiles

## Molecular Dynamics Simulation
- MD simulations carried out using GROMACS
- Stability assessed through trajectory analysis and RMSD calculations
